<p1>
"The knights tour is a classic computing puzzle!"
</p1>
</br>
<p1>
"Can a knight, starting from one spot on the board,
land on every square, only one time?"
</p1>
</br>
<p>
  "It has been proved that for any m × n board with m ≤ n,
   a closed knight's tour is always possible UNLESS one
   or more of these three conditions are met:
 </br>
1 -  m and n are both odd
2 -  m = 1, 2, or 4
3 -  m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8.
 </br>
  ...The Answer is yes, and in many different ways!""</p>
